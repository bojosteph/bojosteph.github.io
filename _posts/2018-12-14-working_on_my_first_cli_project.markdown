It is a good learning and challenging experience to work on this first project. I know the intention is to learn and practice the concept that I have learned so far. I like the fact we can use gems on our project. We can use Bundler to help us out. There are Different Ways to Parse a JSON API with Ruby. I chose using HTTparty to gets the objects I wanted. That is the other thing I learned as I work on this project to not iterate on hashes which is what I was doing in the beginning but work on the Objects and make sure you don't call initialize in the middle of your code. I'm learning more about Classes, instance methods, Class methods. Using namespacing. I was going back to the past lesson and watching videos of CLI gem walkthrough to help me get a good Idea of where to begin I guess that is the important step to take is start working on it. I sometimes spend time working on a particular issue and it will be days before it starts clicking only to realize I have to scrap that idea. StackOverflow is a very good resource and of course our instructor here in Flatiron school. My CLI project is a work in progress but I'm learning a lot and starting to enjoy Ruby Programming More.
