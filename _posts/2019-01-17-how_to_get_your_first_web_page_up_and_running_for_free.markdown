    The best way to Learn is to Build Something. So after going to Courses in
    MDN and W3school.
    I have a basic understanding of HTML 5 and W3.CSS. Knowing which element to
    target and setting up your background with color and image is a good
    knowledge to Have when your designing Website.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    There is plenty of Choices with Web Template you can use to get started or
    you can design a basic one from scratch. I have used HTML5 template and
    Bootstrap Themes and Template Free to use Under Creative Commons and Both
    Require some working Knowledge of HTML and CSS so you can personalize it
    and change Elements. If you are building it from Scratch there is plenty of
    resources for Fonts like Font awesome and Google Fonts. Unsplash is a free
    royalty site for images you can use to design your site. You can use
    iframes to embed Youtube and Google Maps to your webpage without much
    effort.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    For Blogging, there is a free website like Blogger from google and Wordpress.org  has a free site but
    you are limited on how to set it up since they control the layout. You can
    still change the design but its not the same when you are using other
    template and designing it yourself.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
    Jekyll is a free open source blog-aware framework. We are already using it
    in Learn. There are free template for Jekyll if you want to change the
    theme and its free if you have GitHub account.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>

    Once you have designed your website you can either pay a web hosting site,
    run your own server at home or use free web hosting service. I skipped the
    registering domain name here because if you go with a web hosting site they
    will guide you on this like Hostgator or Godaddy.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
    Let's talk More about free web hosting site, They will let you use their
    server but you will be limited under their free service agreement. But if
    your site is Static Website you will fall under this category and you can
    always pay for more services if you want to.
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
    I have used Netlify and you can connect straight to GitHub to get your site
    up and running in no time. it easy to use and no credit card required to
    set up. Your web address will be
    yoursite.netlify.com unless you have a domain name then you can set it up
    that way
    With Netlify you get https which is a secure version of HTTP
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
    Amazon also has a free service under AWS and you can take advantage of it
    for 1 year. Find out more under service agreement after one year on their
    website
</p>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
    Anyway Happy Coding and Get Your Site Up and Running for Free.
