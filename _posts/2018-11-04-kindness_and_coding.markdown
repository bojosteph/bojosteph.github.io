 Changing from another career on your mid 40 is not easy and take a lot of serious thinking and consideration. I am from the medical field and have no experience in coding. I have always been interested in technology and always follows current development in the industry. When I started looking into programming and researched on how to be a programmer for beginners, 
I came across online adds about online boot camp, Thanks Google and Facebook. Anyway, here I am now.

This was not an easy decision for me. I have to consider the impact of my decision on my family and current employer. This is when I realized that my family and co-workers are very supportive and without their kindness and understanding pursuing this new career will not be possible.

Doing programming and working part-time, trying to learn as much as you can while making sure you still spend quality time with your family can be a bit overwhelming.  And finding out how much you don't know and not seeing the progress you expected to make you question your decision. I have to say if not for the kindness and patience of an instructor here in Flatirons
School. I have considered backing out. 

Kindness and Being Kind. We have to apply that with the way we treat ourselves especially when it comes to programming. I wish I have applied that earlier in my study and learning of programming. There was a lot of frustration and anxiety about going to the earlier process that it has affected my ability to go forward. It was only when I realized that the process here is not any different from my current career. Sure it's a different field, But to be a good Physical Therapist you need a mentor and willing attitude to improve your skill. You will always have to learn new skills as you go on with your career. And job satisfaction comes from caring for Patients and People around you.

 I have experienced Kindness and good help from the earlier people I met in my programming study. Without their help, I would not be growing my knowledge as a beginning programmer. You always get helpful feedback on Learn and Slack. The kind pairing partner that's willing to teach a newbie. The Kind instructor that is helping you learn and reach your goals. I am excited to take this step and hopefully became a Software Engineer so I can return the same act of Kindness and Impact the people around me in a positive way.
